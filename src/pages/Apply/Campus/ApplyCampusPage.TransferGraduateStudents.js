        While incoming freshman students are required to live on campus,
        incoming transfer and graduate students are able to apply for housing as
        space allows. The housing application for Spring 2024 opens in the
        myHousing portal on Monday, Nov. 13, 2023, at 9 a.m. Central Time.
        Limited space will be available for the spring semester, and interested
        students may complete the application.

        For students looking for off-campus housing options, we suggest
        utilizing the Off-Campus Resources office for information on Tuscaloosa
        properties and leasing and landlord information.

        Fall 2024 Waitlist
      </h2>
      <p className="text-neutral-600 mt-2">
        A waitlist will be available online beginning January 16, 2024, for
        transfer and graduate students interested in living on campus in Fall
        2024. As space allows, students will be notified when/if they can
        complete the housing application. A $175 deposit ($35 non-refundable
        application fee and $140 prepayment) are due when the housing
        application is completed.

      <p className="text-neutral-600 mt-2">
        HRC will prioritize rising sophomores (current first-year students) for
        campus housing and they will be allowed to apply for housing before
        rising juniors and seniors, as long as they have completed the waitlist
        form while it is available to them. Rising juniors and seniors
        (determined by years on campus rather than academic classification) will
        be prioritized based on the date they add themselves to the waitlist.
      </p>
      <p className="text-neutral-600 mt-2 font-bold">
        Adding yourself to the waitlist does not guarantee housing or obligate a
        student to live on campus. Based on available space, we may not be able
        to accommodate every student who is on the waitlist.
