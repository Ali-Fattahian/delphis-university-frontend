        Move-In volunteers provide a valuable service to our incoming students,

        faith-based group, or local business, we welcome your help to greet more
        than 8,500 students to campus. All volunteers receive beverages and

        Close to 8,000 first-year students will move into residence halls this
        fall and we need your help welcoming them and their families! This is a
        great way to
        <span className="mx-1 font-semibold">
          fundraise for your organization as well as introduce your org to the

        Your time will be spent pushing carts of student belongings from
        unloading zones to student rooms, then back. You’ll have a few minutes
        to chat to new students about your org while you walk with them. There
        may be light lifting in the unloading of the cart, so that we can get
        the carts back to the starting point for the next car.

        Student organizations registered with The Source that volunteer to help
        with Move-In can receive organization funding. Student volunteers may
        only work on behalf of one student organization per each four-hour
        shift. Each student organization registered with The Source receives
        <span className="font-semibold ml-1">$30 per volunteer</span>, per
        four-hour shift. For a registered student organization to receive
        funding credit, student volunteers must work the entire four-hour shift.
        Volunteers must sign in AND out of all shifts.
