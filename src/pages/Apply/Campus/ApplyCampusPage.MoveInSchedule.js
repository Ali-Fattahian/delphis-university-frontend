        Students must have a housing assignment before a move-in day/time can be
        scheduled. Move-In signup for Fall 2024 will begin in June. Details
        regarding the sign up process will be emailed to incoming studentsâ€™
        Crimson email accounts. Move-In times may vary by residence hall.

          We strongly encourage you not to make specific travel plans until you
          have an assignment and have selected your move-in time online.

        If you already know you want to participate in sorority or fraternity
        recruitment, you will need to register for recruitment through the UA
        Panhellenic website (sorority) or the UA IFC website (fraternity). We
        encourage you to do this by June 1 so that you will be able to see early
        move-in times when sign up becomes available.
