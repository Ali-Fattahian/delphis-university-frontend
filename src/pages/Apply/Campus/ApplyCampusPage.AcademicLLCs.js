        We seek to give students every possible opportunity to succeed and are
        excited to offer residents further development opportunities through our
        many diverse Academic Living-Learning Communities (LLC). These programs
        provide residents with access to educational programs and
        extracurricular activities exclusive to each LLC. Each community is
        unique, with specific requirements and living arrangements. Students
        select certain communities during online room selection, while others
        require a separate application and acceptance into that program before
        assignment. Read the following information, and contact LLCs or the HRC
        main office if you have any questions.

        Application deadlines differ among LLCs. Please be aware of application
        requirements if interested in an LLC.
